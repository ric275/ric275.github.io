A growing collection of old, frutiy computers.

Here is a complete list of what I consider to be the major products that make up
my collection of Apple devices. I've organised it by year so one can get a
general idea of what stage Apple was at in said year. Any new items will be
added to the list as and when. I also plan on adding photos of these devices
over time. I'm always looking to grow my collection so if you have any devices
in need of a home, let me know!
