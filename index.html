<h1>A growing collection of old, frutiy computers.</h1>

<p>Here is a complete list of what I consider to be the major products that make up
my collection of Apple devices. I've organised it by year so one can get a
general idea of what stage Apple was at in said year. Any new items will be
added to the list as and when. I also plan on adding photos of these devices
over time. I'm always looking to grow my collection so if you have any devices
in need of a home, let me know!</p>
<p>If you're curious, my <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected/291">Hackett Number</a> is 21.</p>
